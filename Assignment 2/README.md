The group exists of Ling, Brage and Martin. For the most part, Martin and Brage has worked together and Ling for the most time alone since she is living in the USA. It's the first time we are trying to work as a group with members from totally different locations, so this has been the toughest part, with the communication and time differences. We have had different success with the procedures, and not all of them are 100%, but we included some things that we have tried out in the greyed out area so you can have a look at it. Martin and Brage has for the most time worked with the CREATE procedures, and Ling has worked on the ADD procedures.

CREAT_ LOCATION: We can add data in location and printed out error message about attributes that has NULL, however it is not fully completed. We have made an attempt, marked / * * / around it.

We had a trouble on the create_member procedure (no complied). Ling has taken over and succesffuly made it work.
